After enabling Wamellow passports, you can further customize your settings by configuring these options:
- Logging channel
- Unverified member role
- Verified member role 
- Action on verification failure
- Punishment role

Once you've completed the enabling process and any necessary configurations, you can check the preview by clicking the button labeled "View Passport." This allows you to review how Wamellow passports appear and function on your server before making them available to users.
